# React SoundCloud training
![Graham](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44966876/graham_demo.gif)

Search for users, and get the last tracks they liked.

A training I did using **React**(15.3), **Redux**, **Webpack** and the Soundcloud API.

~~Demo link~~ the new app registration process will take up to two weeks

## Running
To test the app locally, you will need your own client id located at `src/app/config/soundcloudConfig.js`.
```
    npm install webpack -g
    npm install
    npm start
```
